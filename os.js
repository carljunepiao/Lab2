/* Desciption and Instruction

    Implement the FCFS, SJF, SRPT, Priority and Round-robin scheduling. Sample data is given to you
    (please refer to process1.txt and process2.txt).
    路 For FCFS and SJF, assume all processes arrived at time 0 in that order.
    路 For SRPT, consider the arrival time of each processes.
    路 For Priority, assume that lower-value priorities have higher priorities (that means 0 is the highest priority).
    路 For round-robin scheduling, assume a uniform time slice of 4 millisecond.

    Display the waiting time for each process for every algorithm, as well as their average computing time.
    Also, perform an algorithm evaluation, based on the datasets given to you.
